# e-commerce-backend

E-commerce-backend is an application design to mimic the back end of an e-commerce site, and provides routes and a database for products, categories, and tags. The entire application runs on Node.js, uses Express.js for routing, SQL for the database, and Sequelize.js for altering the database. The application was designed whilst using Insomnia, and has no front-end.

## Key Features

Sequelize.js: Sequelize.js formats all schemas for interacting with SQL, and creating relationships between different tables.

Express.js: This application uses Express.js for all routing.

SQL database: The database was created in SQL.

Routing: The routes provided permit users to GET ALL, GET ONE, POST, PUT, and DELETE categories, products, and tags.

## Getting Started

To use this application, follow these steps:

Install npm, put down your SQL password and database name into and .env file, run source schema.sql, seed the database with "npm run seed", start the server with "node server.js", and finally test routes in an API development platform using JSON format.

## System Requirements

Must have an API tester.

Must have SQL on your machine.
